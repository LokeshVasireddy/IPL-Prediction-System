# Day 1 — System Autopsy

## Objective
Understand the legacy IPL prediction system before making any architectural or modeling changes.

No refactoring, tuning, infra work, or feature building was performed intentionally.

## Timeline
Project deadline extended to **mid-April** to allow production-grade engineering and modeling decisions.

## System Snapshot
- Backend: Flask  
- ML: TensorFlow LSTM (legacy) + tree baselines  
- Frontend: React  
- Dataset: Ball-by-ball cricket data  

System runs locally end-to-end.

## Environment
- Python: 3.12.10  
- OS: Windows 11  
- CPU: Intel64  
- GPU: Not detected (CPU only)

Environment recreated successfully. Training and inference verified.

## Model Findings

### Legacy Assumption
LSTM chosen because cricket is sequential.

### Critical Discovery
Sequence length = **1**

Result:  
LSTM behaves like a feedforward model with unnecessary complexity.

## Features
- batting_team (one-hot)  
- bowling_team (one-hot)  
- venue (one-hot)  
- over  
- ball  

Targets:
- runs  
- wickets  

`winner` exists but is not modeled directly.

## Baseline Results

| Model | MSE | MAE | RMSE | R² | Adjusted R² |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| XGBoost | 119.35 | 5.97 | 10.92 | **0.786** | 0.785 |
| Random Forest | 149.05 | 6.67 | 12.21 | 0.746 | 0.745 |
| Decision Tree | 151.64 | 6.59 | 12.31 | 0.738 | 0.738 |
| Linear Regression | 147.40 | 6.72 | 12.14 | 0.735 | 0.734 |
| LSTM | ~0.25* | ~0.36* | ~0.50* | ~0.745 | — |

### Key Insight
The problem currently behaves as a **tabular regression task**, not a sequential one.

Production direction will favor gradient boosting unless a true sequential simulator is built.

### Interpretation

- XGBoost achieves the lowest prediction error across all major metrics.
- Tree ensembles outperform both linear and neural approaches on the current feature space.
- The LSTM’s metrics are not directly comparable due to target scaling, but it does not demonstrate a structural advantage.

**Conclusion:**  
Performance gains are more likely to come from improved feature engineering and dataset quality than increased model complexity.

## Dataset Notes
~260k rows, ball-level match state.

### Strengths
- High resolution  
- Progressive scoreboard  
- Simulation potential  

### Weaknesses
- No player skill features  
- No team strength metrics  
- Simplistic encoding  

### Modeling Risk
Current features assume uniform batting capability across teams — unrealistic.

### Prediction Horizon Risk
Late-innings states are easier to predict than early-game scenarios.  
Future validation must segment by match phase.

## Major Insight
Predicting runs ≠ predicting match outcomes.

**Win probability** will be the primary production objective.

## Future Dataset Direction
A new dataset will be engineered using accumulated domain and ML experience.

Focus areas:

- Team strength metrics  
- Player aggregates (without exploding dimensionality)  
- Venue behavior  
- Historical run rates  
- Phase-of-play features  

Dataset quality is expected to drive larger gains than model complexity.

## Technical Debt Identified
- Training coupled with API  
- No dataset versioning  
- Model overwritten without evaluation  
- Preprocessing artifacts not saved  
- No tests / logging / CI  
- Neural model selected before baseline validation (now corrected)

Debt documented — not resolved today.

## Decisions
- Do NOT refactor yet  
- Do NOT migrate frameworks  
- Do NOT tune models  

Clarity before rebuilding.

## Emerging Architecture Direction

### Production Path
**Tabular Outcome Engine**
- reliable  
- interpretable  
- deployable  

### Research Path
**Sequential Match Simulator**
- scenario forecasting  
- ball-by-ball modeling  

## True Sequential Modeling Plan

The original LSTM failed because it was not given real sequences.

A future research track will introduce **true ball-to-ball sequence modeling**, where each prediction is conditioned on prior deliveries within the innings.

Potential capabilities:

- Dynamic match state transitions  
- Scenario simulation  
- Real-time win probability updates  
- Strategy forecasting  

This model will only be pursued after the production tabular engine is stabilized.

Deep learning will be applied where it provides structural advantage — not by default.

The goal is not to use neural networks unnecessarily, but to deploy them where temporal dependency creates modeling leverage.

## Day 1 Result
Ambiguity removed.  
System understood.  
Risks identified.  
Direction clarified.

Project ready for structured engineering work.
